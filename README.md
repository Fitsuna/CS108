#HW PA1 Getting Started
1. Download PA1_template.py from Canvas.
2. Change the name of the file to match the requirements.
3. Insert the required assignment header to your file.
4. Run the program on your computer and observe the results.
5. (Once it works) Upload your file on GradeScope to PA1.
6. Be sure to observe the message "CORRECT!"
Part B: Fixing and Completing Code
1. Remove the triple-quotes on lines #17 and #72.
2. Run the program on your computer and observe the results. (NOTE: You will have
to fix at least one error before it runs!)
3. Complete the Pints and Gallons section so that the results are accurate. Use our
division operators to calculate correct the values. Do not hard code the results.
4. Once it works, re-submit it to GradeScope to PA1. (You will have to fix some
errors and complete some code!)
Part 3: Confirm visit(s) to Piazza

In a comment at the bottom of your PA1B submission (.py file), respond to the
following question (the answer is on Piazza!)

"Why did the computer scientist have their driver's license revoked?"
